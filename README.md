Spotify User Behavior Analysis Dashboard | Power BI, DAX
Objective: Analyze user listening habits to drive data-informed decisions for improving engagement and personalization.

Key Contributions:

Engineered an end-to-end Power BI dashboard tracking 5,000+ user interactions, integrating data from Spotify APIs and SQL databases.

Developed key metrics:

User Engagement: “Minutes Played” (avg. 120 mins/day/user), “Unique URLs Streamed” (1,200+ unique tracks).

Content Preferences: “Top Artists” (Top 5 artists accounted for 30% of streams), “Most Played Albums”.

Platform Behavior: “Mobile vs. Desktop Usage”, “Shuffle Play Rate” (65% of users enabled shuffle).

Data Modeling: Created calculated measures using DAX (e.g., Total Listening Time = SUMX(Data, Data[Duration] / 60)) and optimized SQL queries for efficient data extraction.
